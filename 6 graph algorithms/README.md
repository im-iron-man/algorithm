## TODO

- read chapter 6 in [Introduction to Algorithms](https://book.douban.com/subject/20432061/) and chapter 4 in [Algorithm](https://book.douban.com/subject/10432347)
  - add more features
  - use adjacency-list representation and adjacency-matrix representation to implement graph
- add comments for code
- visualize the process of program
